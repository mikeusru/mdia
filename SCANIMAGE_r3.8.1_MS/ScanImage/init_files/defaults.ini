        % By default, with allowFasterLineScans=0, line scan periods down to 0.5ms/line are supported
        % If allowFasterLineScans=1, line scan periods down to 0.125ms/line are made available -- in the Ms/Line (nominal) dropdown menu
        % WARNING: Such line speeds are likely only possible with acousto-optic deflectors or, maybe, with galvos when opearting at high scanZoomFactor.
        %          Enable the allowFasterLineScans option with full caution, with respect to scanner capabilities and health         
        allowFasterLineScans=1

        parkAngleAllowInvert=1  % Flag (1 = yes, 0=no) specifying to interpret parkAngleX/Y as absolute values; in this case, sign is chosen to park beam on side of start of upcoming scan to minimize scanner transient.
