% SVOBODA LAB MATLAB LIBRARY - TABLE OF CONTENTS
% 
% The functions in this library are for use with software generated in
% the Svoboda lab.  They include many functios for GUI handling, graphics, 
% as well as mathematical manipulations.
% 
% The functions are sorted into the following directories:
% 
%   array_handling			-   Functions dealing with numeric arrays.
%   development_handling    -   Functions used when documenting or commenting code.
%   generic_guis			-   GUIs built to be used with Program Manager
%                               for general incorporation into Programs.
%   gui_building			-   Functions for constructing GUIs (Svoboda Lab Specific)
%   gui_handling			-   Functions for manipulating GUIs 
%   handle_graphic_helpers	-	Functions dealing with handle graphics (Figures, Axes, etc...)
%   image_handling			-	Functions dealing with image data (Some Svoboda Lab Specific)
%   logical					-	Additional is* statements added to enhance coding.
%   math					-   General Math Functions (Used mostly for Fitting Data)
%   software_specific		-   Functions specific to Svoboda Lab Data.
%   string_handling			-   Padding and manipualtion of character arrays.
%   structure_handling		-   Sorting and accessing structure arrays.
